# Financial-Consumer-Complaint-KPI-using-Tableau

**Business Understanding**:

Complaints can give us insights into problems people are experiencing in the marketplace and help us regulate consumer financial products and services under existing federal/state/ central  consumer  financial laws, enforce those laws judiciously, and educate and empower consumers to make informed financial decisions.

The bank is receiving complaints from consumers which is filed against them. Analysts team of bank will analyse the complaint data to provide results on where the most complaints are being filed, what products/ services are producing the most complaints and other useful data.

My analytical dashboard will assist/help bank in identifying the KPIs leading to increased customer satisfaction to drive revenue and profitability.
